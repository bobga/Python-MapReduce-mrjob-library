# Python-MapReduce-mrjob-library
Python MapReduce sample project with mrjob library

Python version 3.8.0

This project requires you to write four MapReduce programs. These programs should be written using Python 3  and the Python mrjob library.
Each solution should distribute computaton across multiple map and/or reducer tasks.

<h3>Part1</h3>
Given a CSV file where each line cotains a set of numbers, write a MapReudce program which determines the maximum of all numbers in the file.
For example, consider the following sample CSV file:
2,2,3
4,3

Given this CSV file, the maximum is 4.

Entitle the python program in question part1.py. That is, entering the following command at the terminal should result in your MapReduce program being applied to fileName.csv pipenv run python part1.py fileName.csv
